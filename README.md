### Problem Statement

- Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is an experimental technique that allows for the control and measurement of nuclear spins in crystals and molecules.
- A common "recipe" for NMR is called the spin echo: the spins start aligned, begin to disperse, and are then refocused. This creates a sharp peak, or "echo", in the net magnetization M of the material at a later time. When the spins interact with each other, this refocused echo can become highly distorted.
- Materials with strong electron-electron couplings have a variety of applications, from superconductivity to ferromagnetism. They also tend to enhance the nuclear spin-spin couplings, allowing NMR to act as a probe of these important systems.
- Design and train a model that predicts the strength and shape of interactions between the nuclear spins from simulated time-dependent magnetization curves, M(t).

Before getting to any code, we first review the structure of this machine learning problem and introduce some of the details of the underlying physics we are trying to capture.


## Quick description of the ML problem

### Goal:
Predict four real numbers from a large input vector of real numbers.

### Example Solution:  Multilayer Neural Network:

To get the complex-valued time-series M(t) into a neural network, we can simply "stack" the real and complex parts together to make a real-valued input vector.

### Example Solution's Figures of Merit:

Using the simple neural network with 15 epochs (the code below only uses 3, for speed), we obtain the following predictions of the four output variables from the M(t) curves:

Note that one of these (correlation strength) is predicted very well, two are partially captured (the correlation and dissipation power), and one is not captured at all (correlation length).


## Introduction to NMR and spin echos


Although the NMR "spin echo" technique may sound complicated, the following animation created by Gavin W Morley (by way of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_echo) makes it much clearer!


![NMR Spin Echo Animation](imgs/HahnEcho_GWM.gif)


The red arrows in this animation represents the values of nuclear spins in the material.
They all begin in the same direction (up), and then an applied magnetic field rotates them into the x-y plane (indicated by the 90-degree pulse).
A constant external magnetic field in the z-direction did not affect the spins when they were pointing "up", but now that they lie in the x-y plane they begin to precess.


Because each nuclear spin sits in a slightly different magnetic environment, each one has a slightly different response to the background z-direction magnetic field, causing some to precess faster or slower than others.


After a fixed amount of time, t in the above animation, a second magnetic pulse is applied and rotates each spin 180 degrees in the x-y plane.
After this, the spins continue to move as they did before, but because of the 180-degree pulse they are now effectively precessing  "backwards" compared to the original motion!
So after an additional time t passes, the variations in precession time is canceled out, causing a refocusing of the spins.

This shows up as a measurable "echo" in the average spin magnetization of the material, and can be measured in experiments.
This is an important technique because the average spin magnetization is hard to measure during an applied pulse, but there is no external pulse during the "echo", allowing for accurate measurement of the peak value and decay shape.

Here is a typical curve for the time-dependent magnetization M(t) for a spin-echo in most materials:

Sometimes, a more complicated curve can occur, such as:

![coupled_echo.png](imgs/coupled_echo.png)

This more complicated structure has been caused by spin-spin interactions between the precessing nuclear spins. Normally, each spin precesses in a uniform way irrespective of the rest of the nuclei in the material. In this coupled case, however, the nuclear magnetization that occurs near the "echo" influences the spins' motions, modifying the shape of the observed echo.


## Electronic and nuclear spins

Most materials can be classified by their electronic properties into three categories: metal, insulator, and semiconductor.
These terms are based on a semi-classical description of the electrons in a crystal.
The electrons are treated as a collection of classical particles, with energies that depend on their momentum in a way determined by the atomic structure of the crystal.

However, there are other electronic phases of matter that are truly "quantum" and cannot be described accurately with a classical analogy.
In these scenarios, complicated structures in the electron states can give rise to large electronic spin density or strong electron-electron coupling.
Because of these strong couplings between electrons, they are often hard to probe experimentally.

Luckily, electrons can interact with the nuclar spins of a material (by way of the hyperfine-interaction).
If the electron-nuclear coupling becomes strong enough (enhanced perhaps by a "qunatum" electronic phase), then a non-neglible two-step process can couple the nuclei with each other throughout the material.
That two-step process is when a nuclear spin couples to an electron and changes its motion, and then that electron later "scatters" off another nuclear spin elsewhere in the material.

Our goal is to develop a model that accurately determines the above four variables from a single M(t) curve.
